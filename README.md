# Full-Stack Starter

This repository contains a "starter" project for web application development in JavaScript. This includes the following components, from front-end to back-end:

- React 18.1.0
- React Router 6.3.3
- Bootstrap 5.1.3
- Node.js 16.15.0
- Express 4.18.1
- Sequelize 6.20.1
- Postgres 13

## One-time Setup

1. On Github, "Fork" this git repo to your own account so that you have your own copy.

   Read more about "forking" here:  
   https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo

2. Clone YOUR copy of the git repo to a "local" directory (on your computer), then change
   into the directory.

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/full-stack-starter.git
   cd full-stack-starter
   ```

3. Install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

   1. If you have Windows Home Edition, you will need to install Docker Toolbox instead.
      See the troubleshooting notes below.

4. Open a command-line shell, change into your repo directory, and execute these commands:

   ```
   docker compose pull
   docker compose up
   ```

   It will take a while the first time you run these commands to download the "images" to
   run the web application code in Docker "containers". When you see messages that look
   like this, the server is running:

   ```
   server_1       | 4:13:08 AM webpack.1 |  You can now view full-stack-starter in the browser.
   server_1       | 4:13:08 AM webpack.1 |    Local:            http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. Now you should be able to open the web app in your browser at: http://localhost:3000/

   1. If you had to install Docker Toolbox, then replace "localhost" with the IP
      address of the Docker Virtual Machine.

6. Open a new tab or window of your shell, change into your repo directory as needed, and execute this command:

   ```
   docker compose exec server bash -l
   ```

   This will log you in to the running server container, as if you were connecting to a different machine over the Internet.
   Once you're logged in, you will be in a new shell for the container where you can run the following command:

   ```
   bin/create-admin Firstname Lastname email password
   ```

   Put in your name and email address and a password. This will create a first user in the database.

7. To stop the server, press CONTROL-C in the window with the running server.
   If it is successful, you will see something like this:

   ```
   Killing full-stack-starter_db_1           ... done
   Killing full-stack-starter_server_1       ... done
   Killing full-stack-starter_mailcatcher_1  ... done
   ```

   If it is not successful, you may see something like this:

   ```
   ERROR: Aborting.
   ```

   If you get an error, the server may still be running on your computer. To force it to stop,
   run the following command and wait for the output to report DONE:

   ```
   docker compose stop
   Stopping full-stack-starter_db_1          ... done
   Stopping full-stack-starter_server_1      ... done
   Stopping full-stack-starter_mailcatcher_1 ... done
   ```

8. That's it! After all this setup is complete, the only command you need to run to get
   started again is the `docker compose up` command.

## Heroku Deployment Setup

1. Create a free Heroku account at: https://signup.heroku.com/

2. Click on the Deploy button below:

   [![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

   In the App Name field, enter a URL-friendly name that will become part of your final url. (i.e. https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com)

3. Install the Heroku CLI (Command Line Interface) tool: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

   On macOS you must first install Homebrew, if you don't already have it: https://brew.sh/

   When successfully installed, you can execute the command:

   ```
   heroku
   ```

   And you will see output like this:

   ```
   CLI to interact with Heroku

   VERSION
   heroku/7.47.6 darwin-x64 node-v12.16.2

   USAGE
   $ heroku [COMMAND]
   ```

4. Link your repo directory to the Heroku deployed app:

   ```
   heroku git:remote -a [YOUR APP NAME FROM STEP 2HERE]
   ```

5. Once linked, you can execute Heroku CLI commands. For example, to run the user creation script on the server:

   ```
   heroku run bin/create-admin Firstname Lastname email password
   ```

## Shell Command Quick Reference

- Every directory and file on your computer has a _path_ that describes its location in storage. Special path symbols include:

  - The current _working directory_ you are in: `.`
  - The _parent_ of the current working directory: `..`
  - Your _home_ directory: `~`
  - The _root_ directory: `/` (Mac, Linux) or `\` (Windows)
    - The same symbol is used as a _separator_ when specifying multiple directories in a path
    - If the path _starts_ with the separator, it means the path starts at the _root_
      - For example: `/Users/myusername/Documents`
      - This is called an _absolute_ path
    - If the path _does not start_ with the separator, it means the path starts at the current _working directory_
      - For example, if the current _working directory_ is: `/Users`  
        then the same path as the previous example is: `myusername/Documents`
      - This is called a _relative_ path
    - A path can also start with any of the above special path symbols
      - For example, on Mac the same path as the previous example is: `~/Documents`

- To _print the working directory_ (i.e. to see the full path of the directory you are currently in):

  ```
  pwd
  ```

- To _list_ the files in the working directory:

  ```
  ls -l
  ```

- To _change_ the working directory:

  ```
  cd path
  ```

- To _make_ a new directory inside the working directory:

  ```
  mkdir newpath
  ```

- To create a new _empty file_ inside the working directory:

  ```
  touch filename.ext
  ```

## git Command Quick Reference

- To check the _status_ of the files in your local repo (i.e. what's been added or changed):

  ```
  git status
  ```

- To _add all_ the changed files to the next commit:

  ```
  git add .
  ```

  To _add specific file(s)_ to the next commit:

  ```
  git add path/to/file1.ext path/to/file2.ext path/with/wildcard/*
  ```

- To _commit_ the added files with a message:

  ```
  git commit -m "My description of what's changed"
  ```

- To _push_ the commit to the remote repo:

  ```
  git push
  ```

- To _pull_ any new commits from the remote repo:

  ```
  git pull
  ```

## Docker Command Quick Reference

- To start all the containers:

  ```
  docker compose up
  ```

- To log in to the running server container:

  ```
  docker compose exec server bash -l
  ```

- To stop all the containers, in case things didn't shutdown properly with CTRL-C:

  ```
  docker compose stop
  ```

- To run the server container without starting everything using the up command:

  ```
  docker compose run --rm server bash -l
  ```

- To re-build the server container:

  ```
  docker compose build server
  ```

## Docker Troubleshooting

- On some PC laptops, a hardware CPU feature called virtualization is disabled by default, which is required by Docker. To enable it, reboot your computer into its BIOS interface (typically by pressing a key like DELETE or F1 during the boot process), and look for an option to enable it. It may be called something like _Intel Virtualization Technology_, _Intel VT_, _AMD-V_, or some similar variation.

- On Windows, Docker Desktop cannot run on Windows Home edition. Install Docker Toolbox instead:

  https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/overview/

  https://github.com/docker/toolbox/releases

  Use the _Docker QuickStart shell_ installed with Docker Toolbox to open a command-line shell that launches Docker for you when it starts. On Windows, right-click on the shotcut and Run as Administrator. Note: this can take a long time to start, depending upon your computer, as it needs to start a virtual machine running Linux.

  The virtual machine will have its own, separate IP address on your computer. To view this IP address, run this command in the command-line shell:

  ```
  docker-machine ip
  ```
